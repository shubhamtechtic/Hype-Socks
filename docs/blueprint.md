# **App Name**: SockAI

## Core Features:

- Logo Upload: Component to upload logo (PNG, JPG, SVG) with size validation (max 5MB).  Shows preview and error messages.
- Prompt Input: Text input field for user design prompts (max 250 chars), showing example text.
- Logo Placement: Interactive visual guide of sock parts (Cuff, Ankle, Instep, Heel, Foot, Sole, Toe) for logo placement selection. Parts are selectable and highlighted to indicate they've been selected.
- AI Design Preview: Display AI-generated sock design preview, allowing users to 'Add to Cart' or 'Regenerate Design'. 'Add to Cart' should only be enabled after design display. An AI tool takes in logo, prompt, and placement to generate design.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vivid orange (#FF7F50) evokes a sense of creativity and energy.
- Background color: A light orange (#FAF0E6) background, which is closely related in hue to the vivid primary color, provides a warm, muted canvas.
- Accent color: A warm-toned pink (#FF69B4), which sits to the 'left' of the primary color on the color wheel, acts as an accent.
- Font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a contemporary, precise feel. Given the relatively small amount of text, a pairing is unneccesary.
